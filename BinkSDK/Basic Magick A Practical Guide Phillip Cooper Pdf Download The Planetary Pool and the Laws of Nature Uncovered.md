# Basic Magick: A Practical Guide by Phillip Cooper - A Review
 
Basic Magick: A Practical Guide is a book by Phillip Cooper that aims to teach the reader how to use magick to effect small changes in the universe that can eventually lead to bigger ones. The book covers topics such as the theory and practice of magick, the four elements, the planets, sigils, servitors, rituals, and more. The book is written in a clear and concise style, with examples and exercises to help the reader apply the concepts.
 
The book is based on the idea of the butterfly theory, which states that a small change in one part of a system can have a large impact on another part. Cooper explains how this applies to magick, and how the reader can use the Cosmic Sphere - an interface between the conscious and subconscious mind - to communicate their wishes to the universe. The book also provides a detailed description of the Inner Temple - a mental construct that serves as a personal sanctuary and a place of power for the magician.

The book is divided into 14 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of magick. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts and principles of magick, such as what it is, how it works, why it works, and what it can do. The second chapter explains how to build a physical and mental temple for magickal work, and what tools and equipment are needed. The third chapter discusses the magical self, and how to develop self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-discipline. The fourth chapter explores the cosmic scheme, and how to understand and align with the natural laws and forces that govern the universe.
 
The next seven chapters deal with the four elements (earth, water, air, fire) and the seven planets (sun, moon, mercury, venus, mars, jupiter, saturn) that correspond to different aspects of reality and human nature. Cooper explains how to use these symbols and energies for magickal purposes, such as creating sigils (magical symbols) and servitors (magical entities). He also provides rituals for each element and planet that can be used for various goals and situations. The 12th chapter describes the Cosmonomicon - a collection of sigils and servitors that Cooper has created and used over the years. The 13th chapter gives an overview of how to perform a ritual, from preparation to execution to closure. The last chapter covers the three outer planets (uranus, neptune, pluto) that represent higher levels of consciousness and transformation.
